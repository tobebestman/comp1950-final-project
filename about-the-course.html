                    <p>
                        This hands-on course follows on from COMP 1850 Applied Web Development Level 1. Students who already understand HTML and
                        CSS will explore web development in more depth with new topics and techniques. Participants will
                        gain a deeper understanding of the latest technologies including HTML5 and CSS3 for developing web
                        sites and applications. There is a focus on responsive design and mobile presentation through the
                        use of Media Queries. Adding behavior to web sites using JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery is
                        introduced. Labs and exercises focus on industry standard web development methodology. Students gain
                        experience creating templates for content management systems and presentation. Additional topics
                        will include: source control for managing your code, and web-based fonts for professional typography.

                        By the end of this course successful students will be able to build dynamic and semantically marked-up content that is viewable
                        on mobile and desktop screen sizes.
